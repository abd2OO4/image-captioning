#Image Captioning with CNN–LSTM

This project implements an image captioning system using **TensorFlow/Keras**.
A pretrained **CNN encoder** extracts visual features, and an **LSTM decoder** generates natural-language captions.
A simple **Streamlit UI** is included (Attached in another repo) for easy inference and testing.

## ✨ Features

* Image feature extraction using a pretrained CNN (DenseNet)
* Caption generation using an LSTM decoder
* Single-image caption generation
* Fully compatible with the Flickr8k dataset
