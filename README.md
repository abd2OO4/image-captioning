🖼️ Image Captioning with CNN–LSTM

A simple image captioning system built using TensorFlow/Keras, combining:

CNN Encoder (DenseNet / InceptionV3)

LSTM Decoder

Tokenizer-based text generation

Streamlit UI for easier access

This project takes an input image and generates a caption based on its visual content.

🚀 Features: 

Extracts image features using a pretrained CNN

Generates captions using an LSTM decoder

Supports single-image caption generation

Fully compatible with the Flickr8K dataset
